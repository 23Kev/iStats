Peak vs Max - Peak is the median daily peak usage, while Max is the highest usage point of the week. Peak is useful for seeing the expected participation numbers if you join at the peak time on any given day, and Max is useful for capturing maximums of low-participation series that have agreed-upon race days where the median peak would otherwise look low.<br>
<br>
Laptimes are calculated based on median results from actual races, so they represent what actual racers achieved in actual races, not "ideal" laptimes. The Fast Lap column, for example, represents median reported Fastest Lap times during races. Note that the data used for iRating-specific is smoothed and extrapolated using domain-specific algoritms - there are not enough data samples to give statistically valid results without massaging the data.<br>
<br>
Note that race times are listed in your local time.<br>
