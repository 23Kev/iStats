This tool was created by <a href="https://members.iracing.com/membersite/member/CareerStats.do?custid=423722">Brian Fiete</a>. The site generation code is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/bfiete/iStats">GitHub</a>.
<br><br>
The presentation is very vanilla - please feel free to submit improvements/suggestions through <a href="https://github.com/bfiete/iStats/issues">GitHub issues</a>, PRs, or email</a> (<a href="mailto:bfiete@gmail.com">bfiete@gmail.com</a>), even in the form of modified HTML files.<br>

TOP AVERAGE/FASTEST LAP: The post-race average/fastest lap time for every entry is sorted, and then the 90th to 95th percentile (fast but non-alien) is averaged. The "+" value shows how much slower this time is from the fastest car time (+0.000 is the fastest car). The "k" value is the average IR from the entries used in the calculation.<br>
<br>
Note that race times are listed in your local time.<br>
